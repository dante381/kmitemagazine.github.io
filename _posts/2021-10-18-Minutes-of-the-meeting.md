1. The deadline to submit articles has been extended to 26th October for third years and 27th for fourth years, considering that we have an NPTEL exam this week.
2. The timeline for submission of articles for second years will remain the same, subject to a few exceptional cases. Upload your articles at the earliest (by 22nd October) so the editors can start reviewing them.
3. The blog will be launched in January 2022 (tentative) - we shall have another meeting after the farewell edition is live to discuss this in more detail.
4. We'll be having an offline meeting on Thursday i.e. 21st October so the team members can get to know each other better. Timings and venue for the same will be informed soon.
